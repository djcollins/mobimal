# MobiMal: Machine Learning For Malaria Diagnosis

## ABSTRACT
Malaria is a major health problem that affects many parts of the
world, where infection can quickly lead to death if victims go untreated. In most areas the most reliable form of malaria diagnosis
is in the microscopic examination of a patients stained blood film
performed by a trained microscopist. This work presents a
tool which uses two different machine learning methods, a Support
Vector Machine and an Artificial Neural Network, to assist in the
analysis of blood stains for malaria diagnosis. After using a series of
preprocessing methods to assist in the identification of individual
blood cell images, both algorithms achieve accuracy scores for the
classification of malaria infected blood cells of above 96%.
